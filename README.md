# Final project CSE 121B

## About the installation
Since the purpose of this class was to learn and demonstrate the knoweledge learned about JavaScript, but I wanted to make this project look good, I developed the UI with a CSS framework

## Requirements
Please make sure to have installed npm and nodejs

## How to run the project
After cloning the reporsitory, on the main directory run the following command line:

```npm i```

Once the dependencies were installed:

```npm run dev```

This will allow to see any changes made to the styling in real time

After those steps, you can run the project with Live Server, and if I didn't do any mistake, everything should work properly
